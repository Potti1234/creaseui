      'Sheet reuses Foldkit’s Dialog child Model. Programmatic open and child update return focus/animation Commands that the parent must map through GotSheetMessage. With side bottom the panel layers a pointer-gesture state machine on top — drag phases, detent offsets computed from snap points, velocity-aware settle, and magnetic capture — and the switcher variant keeps one shared dialog whose sheets swap content with a retained-fade transition.',
