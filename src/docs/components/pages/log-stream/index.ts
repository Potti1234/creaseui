      'A mono grid of log rows (timestamp | level | source | message) with level accents, expandable per-row detail panels, and follow-scroll live tailing with a Jump to latest affordance.',
    architecture:
      'Log Stream is a submodel component. Its Model wraps the shared message-scroller model (scroll position, follow pinning) plus expandedIds for open detail rows. Scrolling away from the tail reveals a jump button that re-pins the stream; ChangedLogStreamFollowing reports pin transitions as an out message.',

    styling:
      'The default variant uses theme surface tokens; the terminal variant is intentionally always-dark — brand chrome mirroring real shells — implemented as a StyleX theme override on the shared tokens. Rows use content-visibility for cheap long lists and appended rows fade in.',
    accessibility:
      'The region is role="log" whose aria-live channel is polite only while following the tail and off while unfollowed, so a busy stream never floods assistive tech. Expandable rows are disclosure buttons with aria-expanded.',
